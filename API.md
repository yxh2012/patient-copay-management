### 2. Submit Payment
**POST** `/patients/{id}/payments`

Submit a payment that can be allocated across one or more copays.

**Path Parameters:**
- `id` (Long, required) - Patient identifier

**Headers:**
- `Content-Type: application/json` (required)
- `Duplicate-Request-Key` (String, optional) - Idempotency key to prevent duplicate charges

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "paymentMethodId": 1,
  "currency": "USD",
  "allocations": [
    {
      "copayId": 1,
      "amount": 25.00
    },
    {
      "copayId": 2,
      "amount": 45.00
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `paymentMethodId` (Long, required) - ID of patient's payment method
- `currency` (String, required) - Currency code (currently only "USD" supported)
- `allocations` (Array, required) - List of copay allocations
    - `copayId` (Long, required) - ID of copay to pay
    - `amount` (Decimal, required) - Amount to allocate to this copay

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "paymentId": 456,
  "status": "PENDING"
}
```

**Business Rules:**
- Supports partial payments (amount less than remaining balance)
- Supports overpayments (amount greater than remaining balance creates patient credit)
- Payment processing is asynchronous - status updates via webhook
- Idempotency prevents duplicate payments with same request key

- Analyzes payment patterns and provides actionable recommendations
- Healthcare-specific insights based on visit patterns

- `failureCode` (String, optional) - Failure reason if payment failed
    - Examples: `card_declined`, `insufficient_funds`, `card_expired`

**Success Response (200):**
Empty response body with 200 status code.

**Webhook Processing:**
- Updates payment status (PENDING â†’ SUCCEEDED/FAILED)
- Updates copay remaining balances and status
- Handles credit reversals for failed overpayments
- Implements duplicate webhook protection
- All database changes are transactional

---

## Payment Processing Flow

1. **Submit Payment** - Client calls POST `/patients/{id}/payments`
2. **Immediate Response** - API returns payment ID with "PENDING" status
3. **Async Processing** - Payment submitted to processor simulation (2-5 second delay)
4. **Webhook Callback** - Processor calls POST `/webhooks/processor` with result
5. **Status Update** - Payment and copay statuses updated in database
6. **Client Polling** - Client can query copays to see updated payment status

## Idempotency

All payment submissions support idempotency via the `Duplicate-Request-Key` header. Submitting the same request key multiple times will return the same payment result without creating duplicate charges.

## Rate Limiting

No rate limiting implemented in this demonstration version. Production deployment would include appropriate throttling.
